My hobby is dancing. I love dancing. 
I like ballet. I have seen a lot of 
ballets in my life. But I liked Giselle
the most. Ballet Giselle is about yang 
girl. She lived in a small village.
I will not tell you everything. Watch
by your self. It is very beautiful
story. I like it very much.

<h2>Ballet</h2> 
<p>Ballet is a musical and theatrical genre in which several types of music, dance, painting, drama and fine arts are closely intertwined, uniting them into a well-coordinated performance that unfolds before the audience on the theater stage.</p> 
<p>Ballet considered be many to be a very beautiful because it combines grace, elegance, refinement and aesthetic perfection of movement.In dance, you can tell an entire story through every movement of the body.
Even many artists, inspired by them, beautifully painted scenes of dance lessons and performances. For example, Edgar Degas.
 Look how beautifully he paints with his pastel on the canvas. His paintings are awesome
</p> 
<h2>Anna Pavlova</h2>
<p>Anna Pavlova is one of the best ballerinas in the history of Russia.
She managed to dance lot of ballets in her life, for example: "Dying swan", "Giselle", 
"Sleeping Beauty"...</p>
<p>She danced in many cities and countries around the world (London, New York, Paris...)
 When Anna came back from a tour, she always brought back various birds from there.
 In addition to small birds, she also had peacocks, swans and flamingos.
</p>
<h2>Point shoes</h2>
<p>Point shoes were invented in 1830 by Maria Camargo. In the beginning there were 
no ballet shoes. There were only shoes or people were dancig bootlessly. Maria Taglioni was the first 
women that was dancing on points. She was dancing ballet La Sylphide. 

</p>
<h2>La Sylphide</h2>
<p>La Sylphide is unique in terms of the purity and clarity of its ballet style.
This is a true classical ballet, which combines beautiful form with deep meaning.
The main character is in love with an ideal being, a female spirit, and this love leads to a tragic outcome.</p>
<p>So the question arises: should we strive so hard to fulfill a dream if everything can be lost in the chase? 
The confrntation between the real and surreal worlds of acts I and II foreshadows Giselle that was created almostva decaded later.</p>

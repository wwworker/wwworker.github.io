        The ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in December 1869. In 1871, Petipa reworked the production for the St. Petersburg stage.
        In 1900, Alexander Gorsky presented his version of the ballet. He altered the mise-en-scène, enlivened the corps de ballet, and modernized the production,
        preserving its national flavor and dance technique but making it lighter and more festive than Petipa's. 
        Almost all modern productions of Don Quixote use Gorsky's new version, while retaining Minkus's original music.</p>
        Brief story:
        <p>In Barcelona, the innkeeper Lorenzo wants to marry his daughter Kitri to the wealthy but unloved Gamache.
        Kitri is in love with the poor barber Basilio, who is in love with her in return.
        Don Quixote, captivated by chivalric romances, sees Kitri as his imaginary love interest, Dulcinea.
        In one scene, Basilio fakes suicide to force Lorenzo to bless his marriage to Kitri. Kitri pleads with her father, who relents, but Basilio, to everyone's surprise, quickly "resurrects."
        The ballet ends with Kitri and Basilio happily married, and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza set off in search of new adventures.</p>

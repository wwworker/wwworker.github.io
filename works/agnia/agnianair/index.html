My hobby is dancing. I love dancing. 
I like ballet. I have seen a lot of 
ballets in my life. But I liked Giselle
the most. Ballet Giselle is about yang 
girl. She lived in a small village.
I will not tell you everything. Watch
by your self. It is very beautiful
story. I liked it very much.

<p>Ballet considered be many to be a very beautiful because it combines grace, elegance, refinement and aesthetic perfection of movement.In dance, you can tell an entire story through every movement of the body.Even many artists, inspired by them, beautifully painted scenes of dance lessons and performances. For example, Edgar Degas. Look how beautifully he paints with his pastel on the canvas. His paintings are awesome
